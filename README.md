# Data Science Resources
Hi folks, Jav here. I've created a list of data science resources to introduce you to the world of data analytics, data science, and programming. I'll continue to update this list as I learn of new resources / tools and if you have any suggestions, please let me know at <github@encryptme.33mail.com>.

## Online Resources

* [SuperDataScience Courses](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/intro-data-science-step-by-step-guide/): I'm a huge fan of Kiril Eremenko's SuperDataScience, and now they're offering online intro courses (their $1 Premium 30-day trial will get you access to over 20 courses)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability): Statistics is critical for any data scientist, and the Khan Academy statistics and probability lessons will provide you with the basics
* [Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025): I know two people who have taken this course and raved about it, but it requires some understanding of statistics and experience working with data (Udacity has other data science courses that are easier difficulty)
