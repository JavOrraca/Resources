# Data Science Resources
Hi folks, Jav here. I've created a list of data science resources to introduce you to the world of data analytics, data science, and programming. I'll continue to update this list as I learn of new resources and tools, and if you have any suggestions, please send me a note at <github@encryptme.33mail.com>.

## Online Resources

* [freeCodeCamp's Best Courses](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e): freeCodeCamp ranks online data science courses on their Medium blog
* [SuperDataScience Courses](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/intro-data-science-step-by-step-guide/): I'm a huge fan of Kiril Eremenko's SuperDataScience, and now they're offering online intro courses (their $1 Premium 30-day trial will get you access to over 20 courses)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability): Statistics is critical for any data scientist, and the Khan Academy statistics and probability lessons will provide you with the basics
* [Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025): I know two people who have taken this course and raved about it, but it requires some understanding of statistics and experience working with data (Udacity has other data science courses that are easier difficulty)

## Podcasts
Outside of the classroom, podcasts help me stay current with data science news and local events. If you have any podcast suggestions that touch on analytics careers, data science, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, I'd love to hear from you!

* [Super Data Science Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience): Hosted by Kiril Eremenko, the goal of the Super Data Science podcast is to bring you the most inspiring data scientists and analysts from around the world
* [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast?limit=10&offset=0): Hosted by Kyle Polich, _Data Skeptic_ aims to reveal the science of fake news
* [The Science of Social Media](https://soundcloud.com/the-science-of-social-media): Created by Buffer (social media account management and post scheduling tool), this podcast is great for understanding how data science is being used in marketing and advertising, and explores technologies around social media analytics
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/): This podcast is great for students and practitioners, each episode covering the complexities of a specific data science topic, e.g., A/B testing and compliance bias, data privacy laws, text analysis (and tools like Word2Vec), computational limitations, AutoML tools, etc.

## Books
The following books were part of my graduate coursework or have been recommended to me by friends or data science influencers.

* Eremenko, Kirill. _Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career_. Kogan Page, 2018.
   * From the creator of SuperDataScience, this was an easy "for fun" read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I'm not on Kiril's payroll(!)... he's just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives.

* Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. _Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking_. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.
   * This was one of the textbooks for Foundations of Data Science, a graudate course at UCI that I took. Examples are denser and math-heavier than _Confident Data Skills_. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role.
