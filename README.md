# Data Science Resources
Below is a list of data science resources to introduce you to the world of data analytics, data science, and programming. I'll update this list periodically as I learn of new resources and tools. R and Python are open-source programming languages used for data analytics, statistical analysis, web scraping, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. If you have any suggestions, send me a note at <github@encryptme.33mail.com>, thanks.

## Online Educational Resources

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): World's largest community of data scientists and machine learners, with discussion boards, downloadable datasets, and competitions to reinforce your programming skills with R, Python, etc.
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability): Statistics is critical for any data scientist, and the Khan Academy statistics and probability lessons will provide you with the basics
* [Super Data Science Courses](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/intro-data-science-step-by-step-guide/): I'm a huge fan of Kiril Eremenko's SuperDataScience, and now they're offering online intro courses (their $1 Premium 30-day trial will get you access to over 20 courses)
* [freeCodeCamp's Best Courses](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e): freeCodeCamp ranks online data science courses on their Medium blog
* [Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025): I know two people who have taken this course and raved about it, but it requires some understanding of statistics and experience working with data (Udacity has other data science courses that are easier difficulty)

## Podcasts
Outside of the classroom, podcasts help me stay current with data science news and local events. If you have any podcast suggestions that touch on analytics careers, data science, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, I'd love to hear from you!

* [Super Data Science Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience): Hosted by Kiril Eremenko, the goal of the Super Data Science podcast is to bring you the most inspiring data scientists and analysts from around the world
* [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast?limit=10&offset=0): Hosted by Kyle Polich, _Data Skeptic_ aims to reveal the science of fake news
* [The Science of Social Media](https://soundcloud.com/the-science-of-social-media): Created by Buffer (social media account management and post scheduling tool), this podcast is great for understanding how data science is being used in marketing and advertising, and explores technologies around social media analytics
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/): This podcast is great for students and practitioners, each episode covering the complexities of a specific data science topic, e.g., A/B testing and compliance bias, data privacy laws, text analysis (and tools like Word2Vec), computational limitations, AutoML tools, etc.

## Books

* Eremenko, Kirill. _Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career_. Kogan Page, 2018.
  * From the creator of Super Data Science, this was an easy "for fun" read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I'm not on Kiril's payroll(!)... he's just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives.

* Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. _Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking_. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.
  * This was one of the textbooks for Foundations of Data Science, a graudate course at UCI that I took. Examples are denser and math-heavier than _Confident Data Skills_. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role.

## R: The Basics
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/): To get started with R, download and install RStudio's open-source desktop IDE
* [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html): Once RStudio is installed (or your IDE of choice), installing the swirl package is as easy as typing _install.packages("swirl")_ in the RStudio console
  * This R package includes 15 interactive lessons (about 30 minutes each) that teach you the fundamentals of R programming and the data structures
* [R for Excel Users](https://www.rforexcelusers.com/): Pivoting from a financial modeling background to data science, this blog was helpful in understanding how to do common "Excel stuff" in R
* [RStudio shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts): Keystrokes make everything faster, and this certainly helps
  * Tip for Excel users: If you're using Excel regularly, stop using your mouse!
* [Introduction to dplyr]: After installing the dplyr package, you can copy/paste sample R code from this site to learn how to use dplyr functions
  * dplyr is one of the [Tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) that makes data manipulation and summarization easier and faster to do in R
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): While R's base graphing capabilities are powerful, the ggplot2 package makes it easier to produce high-quality plots and visualizations

## Python: The Basics
_Many great online Python trainings tell you to install Python 2.x, but Python 3.x builds are the future of the language, so don't even bother with Python 2.x. Ping me if you need help installing Python._    

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): A plethora of Python IDEs exist, PyCharm just happens to be my Python desktop IDE of choice
  * The full version is $89 USD for individual users, but if you're an active student, you can download the entire suite for free.
  * You can download a free stripped-down community version but it lacks full web development, database and SQL support
