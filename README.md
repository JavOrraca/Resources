# Data Science Resources
Hi folks, Jav here. I've created a list of data science resources to introduce you to the world of data analytics, data science, and programming. I'll continue to update this list as I learn of new resources / tools and if you have any suggestions, please let me know at <github@encryptme.33mail.com>.

## Online Resources

* [freeCodeCamp's Best Courses](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e): freeCodeCamp ranks online data science courses on their Medium blog
* [SuperDataScience Courses](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/intro-data-science-step-by-step-guide/): I'm a huge fan of Kiril Eremenko's SuperDataScience, and now they're offering online intro courses (their $1 Premium 30-day trial will get you access to over 20 courses)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability): Statistics is critical for any data scientist, and the Khan Academy statistics and probability lessons will provide you with the basics
* [Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025): I know two people who have taken this course and raved about it, but it requires some understanding of statistics and experience working with data (Udacity has other data science courses that are easier difficulty)

## Podcasts
Outside of the classroom, podcasts help me stay current with data science. If you have any podcast suggestions (analytics, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.), I'd love to hear from you.

## Books
The following books I've read as part of my graduate coursework or I've they have been recommended to me by friends or data science influencers.

* Eremenko, Kirill. _Confident Data Skills: Master the Fundamentals of Working with Data and Supercharge Your Career_. Kogan Page, 2018.
   * From the creator of SuperDataScience, this was an easy "for fun" read, light math, and provides an overview of data analytics and careers in this field. I swear I'm not on Kiril's payroll(!)... he's just a data science career guru with fresh perspectives.
   * [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0749481544/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=superdatascie-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0749481544&linkId=bb7507851a740c1eb7f45ab4b6bd2a84)

* Provost, Foster and Fawcett, Tom. _Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking_. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.
   * This was one of the textbooks for Foundations of Data Science, a graudate course at UCI that I took. Examples are denser and math-heavier than _Confident Data Skills_. This would be most appropriate for anyone actively trying to move into a data science role.
